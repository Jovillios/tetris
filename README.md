# tetris

A tetris implementation using pygame

This is my first personal programming project with pygame.

This is of course not a very complex game, but the fact that it can easily be implemented in a few hundred lines with pygame is pretty cool, and it shows how powerful and intuituve this library is for coding 2D games.
